   <p>Sneakers are more than just footwear — they’re a fashion statement. To keep them looking fresh and lasting longer, a little care goes a long way.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">1.</span>  Clean Regularly:</strong> Wipe your sneakers after each wear with a damp cloth. For deeper cleaning, use mild soap and a soft brush to remove stains and dirt.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">2.</span>  Air Dry Only:</strong> Never put your sneakers in direct sunlight or a dryer. Let them air-dry naturally to prevent color fading or cracking.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">3.</span>  Use Shoe Trees:</strong> Shoe trees help maintain the shape of your sneakers and prevent creases, especially for leather or canvas pairs.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">4.</span>  Protect with Spray:</strong> A good waterproof or stain-repellent spray can save your sneakers from unexpected spills and rain.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">5.</span>  Rotate Your Pairs:</strong> Don’t wear the same pair every day — rotating gives them time to breathe and last longer.</p>

<p>With simple, consistent care, your sneakers will stay clean, comfortable, and ready to complement any outfit.</p>
