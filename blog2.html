    <p>Healthy, glowing skin starts with simple habits and the right products. You don’t need expensive treatments — just a consistent skincare routine and a bit of care every day.</p>

<p><strong>1. Cleanse Daily:</strong> Wash your face twice a day to remove dirt, oil, and sweat. A gentle cleanser keeps your skin fresh and prevents breakouts.</p>

<p><strong>2. Exfoliate Weekly:</strong> Use a mild scrub or exfoliant once or twice a week to remove dead skin cells and reveal smoother, brighter skin underneath.</p>

<p><strong>3. Moisturize:</strong> Hydration is key! Choose a moisturizer that suits your skin type — lightweight for oily skin and creamy for dry skin.</p>

<p><strong>4. Use Sunscreen:</strong> Never skip sunscreen. It protects your skin from harmful UV rays and prevents early aging and dark spots.</p>

<p><strong>5. Eat Healthy & Stay Hydrated:</strong> Glowing skin starts from within. Drink plenty of water and eat fruits rich in vitamins and antioxidants.</p>

<p>With consistency and care, your skin will stay fresh, smooth, and naturally radiant every day.</p>
